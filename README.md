# MIDI-Wind-Controller

## A brief overview of the repo

- 3D designs contains dxf and svg files.  Design was done in Fusion 360 and then exported.
- Datasheets contains datasheets. Woah.
- Doppler contains WIP code for use with the dadamachines doppler board and is the most up to date codebase. It is built from the hex-leds-test example code.  It currently sends midi messages over USB, and shows the midi note number in binary on the LED grid on the doppler board.
- MidiSax_Leonardo contains an Arduino sketch used for testing USB midi using the previous version of the midi saxophone.  It should be fairly easy to follow.
